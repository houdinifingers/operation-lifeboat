probably looking pretty scary.  Don't worry, we're professionals!  We'll get things back up and
running in no time!

I want to take some time and explain what we're trying to do here.  In a cyberattack, the attackers
generally try cause as much confusion as possible.  They may take down critical infrastructure systems
leaving your organization's computer systems with limited ability to communicate and work.

`operation-lifeboat` is a tool to get your organization limping back to it's feet as fast as possible.
We are going to accomplish this by giving your organization email, chat, and a ticketing system for
tracking work.  This is all built on a secure by design architecture using linux containers that keep
the bad guys out and let you and your co-workers regroup from a position of strength.
