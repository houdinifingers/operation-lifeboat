Hello there.  If you are reading this your organization is probably in rough shape and things are
probably looking pretty scary.  Don't worry, we're professionals!  We'll get things back up and
running in no time!

I want to take some time and explain what we're trying to do here.  In a cyberattack, the attackers
generally try cause as much confusion as possible.  They may take down critical infrastructure systems
leaving your organization's computer systems with limited ability to communicate and work.

opperation-lifeboat is a tool to get your organization limping back to it's feet as fast as possible.
We are going to accomplish this by giving your organization email, chat, and a ticketing system for
tracking work.  This is all built on a secure by design architecture using linux containers that keep
the bad guys out and let you and your co-workers regroup from a position of strength.

This user guide will outline everything you and your team needs to start rebuilding your enterprise.
