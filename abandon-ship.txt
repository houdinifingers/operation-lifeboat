Hey if you're reading this, these steps are best performed by a linux administrator, or someone
with some linux experience, but this guide is written for someone with little to no linux
experience.  Try to follow the instructions to the best of your ability.  If you get stuck,
shoot us a message in GitHub and we'll do what we can to help.

This "infrastructure in a box" is intended for use during a cyberattack where most or all of your
normal infrastructure is down, unavailable, or compromised.  This will provide all specified users
with a user account, password vault, email, chat program, and ticketing system. The users credentials
for login are stored in the password vault.  All users' vault passwords will be written to the
/tmp/userinit.txt on the k3os server you will stand up.  Distribute them to the users so they can
get their username and password to log into email, chat and ticketing system. All accounts will be
formatted firstname.lastname and email addresses firstname.lastname@domain.

It's a good idea, while you are performing this install to download minnow-template.csv from this
repository and get it to your incident response team. They can start building a list of users, that
will need access to this environment, while you do the important work! ^_^

Now on to the install!

### INSTALL STEPS ###

1. Breath!  It's going to be ok. This too shall pass.

2. Find a nice beefy pizza box server that's now collecting dust in your shattered husk of a
datacenter.  Make sure it has 8 or more cpu cores, 16 or more GB of ram and we recommend 100GB
or more of disk space.

3. Download the latest k3os .iso for your architecture (most likely k30s-amd64.iso).
You can download the .iso from this link https://github.com/rancher/k3os/releases/

OPTIONAL:  If you're super cool, remaster the ISO with a k3os.password=<your-password> kernel
parameter in the grub config and skip steps 5 through 7.

4. When the system boots it will display the grub boot loader with some options, you
will want to use the option to install k3os.  You will be prompted for a few options,
if you don't know what those options do it's best to leave them set to default.  After
the install completes reboot the server.

5. When the system reboots the grub loader will be displayed again with a countdown.
Hit the "e" key to go into edit mode.

6. At the line that starts with linux put k3os.password=<your-password> at the end of
the line.

7. Hit the F10 key to boot into k3os.

8. Log in to the server with the user "rancher" and the password you created in step 3
or step 6.

9. Install helm version 3 by entering ,in order, the following commands:
cd /tmp
wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf helm-v3.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm

10. Check that helm is installed by running the following command:
helm help

NOTE: This should display the helm help page, if it doesn't step 9 was not performed
properly

11. Change directory to /var with the following command:
cd /var

12. wget repo
# needs work

13. Copy the minnow-template.csv in the repository and fill it out with users you would
like to be able to access this environment.

14. Rename the template from step 13 to "minnowii.csv" and put it back in the /var

15. Run bootstrap.sh with the following command:
./bootstrap.sh --domain-name "your-domain"

EXAMPLE: ./bootstrap.sh --domain-name firestorm.org

16. Breath!  You've completed the setup.
